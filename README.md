# NBA Ref Analytics

NBA Ref Analytics is an informational data project that explores NBA referee trends across seasons using publicly available referee statistics. The project analyzes officiating patterns such as foul differential, home-team indicators, referee consistency, and statistical outliers.

The goal is to make referee data easier to explore and to surface patterns that may be worth deeper analysis. The results should be interpreted as statistical indicators, not proof of referee bias or game manipulation.

## Features

- Browse NBA referee statistics across multiple seasons
- Filter referee data by season, split, and minimum games officiated
- Analyze foul differential between home and road teams
- Calculate a home bias index using multiple weighted indicators
- Identify statistical outliers using z-scores
- Compare referee consistency across seasons
- Display results through an informational frontend and FastAPI backend

## Installation

Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd nba-ref-analytics
```

## Frontend

The React/Vite frontend calls the FastAPI backend for dashboard data and calculated metrics:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then open one of these routes:

```txt
http://localhost:3000/#intro         Intro page
http://localhost:3000/#data          Data dashboard
http://localhost:3000/#future        Conclusions page
http://localhost:3000/#conclusions   Conclusions page alias
```

## Backend

Install backend dependencies:

```bash
cd backend
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run the FastAPI server:

```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8000
```

Which will be available at:

```txt
http://127.0.0.1:8000
http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs
```

## Docker

Run the frontend and backend together:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

The combined site is available through Nginx at:

```txt
http://localhost/
http://localhost/#data
http://localhost/#future
```

Nginx proxies backend requests under `/api`, so the health check is available at:

```txt
http://localhost/api/health
```

For local debugging, the directly exposed services remain available at `http://localhost:3000` (frontend) and `http://localhost:8000` (backend).

## Data

The data aggregated and used in this project is sourced from NBAstuffer.com. The stored CSV data is located in `data/raw/`. The backend reads this CSV and calculates derived metrics via service functions. The frontend treats the backend API as the source of truth for referee rows, filters, summary metrics, and conclusion graph data.

## Methodology

This project currently uses descriptive statistics, weighted averages, standard deviation, and z-scores to identify officiating patterns.

Current metrics include:

- Foul Differential: compares fouls called against road teams versus home teams.
- Home Bias Index: combines home win percentage, home point differential, and foul differential into a weighted score.
- Outlier Analysis: identifies referee-season rows that differ meaningfully from the population average.
- Consistency Analysis: compares a referee’s variation across seasons against the overall population baseline.

Note: These metrics are exploratory and should be interpreted cautiously. The metrics are calculated from public data, but interpretation remains exploratory. These results can highlight unusual patterns or trends, but they do not independently prove intent, bias, or causation.
